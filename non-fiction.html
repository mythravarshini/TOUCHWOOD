<p>Nonfiction or non-fiction is any document or content that purports in good faith to represent truth and accuracy regarding information,
 events, or people.<br>Nonfiction content may be presented either objectively or subjectively, and may sometimes take the form of a story.
 Nonfiction is one of the fundamental <br>divisions of narrative (specifically, prose)writing in contrast to fiction, which offers information,
 events, or characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary, <br>or else leaves open if and how the work refers to reality.Nonfiction's
 specific factual assertions and descriptions may or may not be accurate, and can give either a true <br>or a false account of the subject in 
question. However, authors of such accounts genuinely believe or claim them to be truthful at the time of their composition or, <br>at least, 
pose them to a convinced audience as historically or empirically factual.</p>
