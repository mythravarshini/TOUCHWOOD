<p style="color:white">In our quest to know what books to read to get a better understanding of India’s history, we turned to you, our readers. <br>
A few days ago we asked everyone on our Facebook and Twitter pages to recommend a book on Indian history. <br>Many of you responded with some 
wonderful suggestions. We also received many e-mails suggesting books we had never heard of. <br>Here then, is the list of 10 books 
(in no particular order) on Indian history that we have compiled based on your responses.</p>
